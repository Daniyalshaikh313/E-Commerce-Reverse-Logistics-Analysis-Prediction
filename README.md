# E-Commerce-Reverse-Logistics-Analysis-Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Objective:
Analyze return trends, predict high-risk return items, and optimize the reverse logistics process to reduce costs using SQL, Python, Tableau/QuickSight, and Machine Learning.

## ðŸ“š Project Plan:
1. *Data Extraction, Cleaning, and Preprocessing
2. * EDA, Model Development & Evaluation
3. * Dashboard Creation, Insights, and Recommendations

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset Overview:
- **Orders Table:** OrderID, CustomerID, ProductID, OrderDate, Region, Quantity, Price, DeliveryStatus
- **Returns Table:** ReturnID, OrderID, ReturnReason, ReturnDate, Status
- **Customer Table:** CustomerID, CustomerType, Location

## ðŸ”¥ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values using `fillna()` and `dropna()`.
- Converted date columns to datetime format.
- Identified and corrected outliers.
- Standardized categorical data.

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Key Insights:

- **Return Rate by Region:** High returns in North America and Europe.
- **Top Products with High Return Rates:** High-value and defective items.
- **Customer Type and Return Behavior:** B2C customers return more frequently.
- **Delivery Status Impact on Returns:** Delayed deliveries increase return rates.

## ðŸ¤– Return Prediction Model (Logistic Regression)
- **Features:** Region, Price, Quantity, CustomerType, DeliveryStatus
- **Target Variable:** Return_Flag (1 if return, 0 otherwise)
- **Model Accuracy:** 85%

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard KPIs:
1. Return Rate by Region â€“ Map Visualization
2. Top 10 Products with Highest Return Rates â€“ Bar Chart
3. Return Behavior by Customer Type â€“ Pie Chart
4. Impact of Delivery Status on Returns â€“ Stacked Bar Chart

## ðŸ“¢ Recommendations:
- Implement stricter quality checks for high-risk items.
- Prioritize timely deliveries to reduce delays.
- Use predictive models to flag high-risk orders before shipping.
- Offer targeted incentives for B2B customers to promote loyalty.

## ðŸŽ¯ Process Optimization:
Reduced return costs by **12%** through improved process efficiency and predictive modeling.
